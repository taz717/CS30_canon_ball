Do what you want 'cause a pirate is free
You are a pirate!

Yar har, fiddle de dee
Being a pirate is alright to be
Do what you want 'cause a pirate is free
You are a pirate!

You are a pirate! Yay!

We've got us a map (a map!)
To lead us to a hidden box
That's all locked up with locks (with locks!)
And buried deep away
We'll dig up the box (the box!)
We know it's full of precious booty!
Burst open the locks!
And then we'll say, "Hooray!"

Yar har, fiddle de dee
If you love to sail the sea
You are a pirate!!
Weigh anchor!

Ar yar, ahoy and avast
Dinky-dink-dink-a-dinkadefast!
Hang the black flag at the end of the mast!
You are a pirate!

Hahahahaha! Yay!

We're sailing away (set sail!)
Adventure awaits on every shore
We set sail and explore (ya-har!)
And run and jump all day (yay!)
We float on our boat (the boat!)
Until its time to drop the anchor
Then hang up our coats (aye-aye!)
Until we sail again!

Yar har, fiddle de dee
If you love to sail the sea
You are a pirate!!

Blue sky above and blue ocean below
You are a pirate!
Hahahahahaha! You're a pirate!
